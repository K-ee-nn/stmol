# streamlit_3dmol
This project aims to provide an easy way to create a web app for interacting with molecular structures using Streamlit. 
Currently sub0.py is simply a static component call to 3Dmol.js by means of  component.html(), but the implementation of a bi-directional component seems to be straightforward.

You must first install streamlit :
<p>
$ pip install streamlit

Then you can run
$ streamlit run sub0.py
